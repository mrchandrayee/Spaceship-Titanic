# Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning from Cosmic Disasters

Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic project repository! This project is part of a data science competition where the goal is to predict which passengers on the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension after a collision with a spacetime anomaly. In this repository, you'll find the code, datasets, and documentation related to our machine learning approach to tackle this challenge.

## Competition Overview

In this cosmic adventure, we are tasked with predicting which passengers of the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension following a collision with a spacetime anomaly. To accomplish this, we employ machine learning classification techniques using the provided dataset.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mrchandrayee/Spaceship-Titanic.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**: Dive into the `notebooks` directory to explore Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model building.

4. **Run Scripts**: Utilize the scripts in the `src` directory for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

5. **Experiment and Contribute**: Feel free to experiment with different models, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameters. Contributions are welcome!

## Notes

- Make sure to replace the placeholder datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) with the actual dataset files provided for the competition.
- The trained model files (`RandomForest.pkl` or any other models) will be generated after running the model training script.
- Refer to the Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis and insights into the dataset and model development process.
